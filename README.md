# Projects: First Year
Here are the projects from the first year of my technical course.

## First project
- In this first project, the software asks the user to enter a date. After typing, the program makes calculations to arrive at which day of the week this informed date refers to, and informs this to the user.

## Second project
- In this second project, the software I developed asks the user to inform the name of a candidate, the course he chose, the grade he got on the test, and his age. The program checks if the participant passed the test, and also identifies who got the highest grade in each course. At the end, it informs the user about this, in addition to showing the total number of approved in relation to the total number of participants.

## Third project
- In this third project, we had to develop a software that asked the user to input their CPF, digit by digit. After entering the CPF, the program performs several calculations to check if the CPF is valid or not, and informs the user. At the end of the program, it also informs the total number of CPF's tested, how many were valid and how many were invalid.

## Fourth project
- In this project I developed a program to inform students about the results of the school year (passed, final exam, retained). The program should allow typing of 5 subjects (in this case, according to the instructions in the statement, each subject would be represented by just one digit, stored in different indices of a vector) and 4 grades for each subject. In addition, the program should contain structures studied throughout the academic year (condition structures, repetition, vectors and matrices, procedures and functions).
