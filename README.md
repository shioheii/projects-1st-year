# Projects: 1st year
Here are the projects from the first year of my technical course.

## First project
- In this first project, the software asks the user to enter a date. After typing, the program makes calculations to arrive at which day of the week this informed date refers to, and informs this to the user.

## Second project
- In this second project, the software I developed asks the user to inform the name of a candidate, the course he chose, the grade he got on the test, and his age. The program checks if the participant passed the test, and also identifies who got the highest grade in each course. At the end, it informs the user about this, in addition to showing the total number of approved in relation to the total number of participants.
